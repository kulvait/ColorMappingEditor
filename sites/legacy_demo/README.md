# Legacy Demo (Vite + React + TypeScript) for Transfer Function Editor

This project is a **modernized version** of the original `transfer-function-editor-example` demo, translated to use **Vite** as the build tool, **React** as the UI library, and **TypeScript** for type safety. The purpose of this repo is to ensure that the original functionality of the Transfer Function Editor is preserved while adopting modern web development practices.

## 🎯 Purpose

The **legacy demo** allows you to test and interact with the **Transfer Function Editor** and its related functionality. It is a direct translation of the original demo, with the following goals:

- Convert from **Parcel** to **Vite** for faster builds and better development experience.
- Migrate from **Vanilla JavaScript** to **React + TypeScript**.
- Ensure that the original features and functionality are preserved and functional in the new setup.
- This project is **dependent on the main package** (`color-mapping-editor`), meaning it uses the built package as a dependency to verify compatibility.
